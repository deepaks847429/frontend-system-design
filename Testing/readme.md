# testing
- testing is a crucial aspect of frontend development to ensure that the user interface work as intended and provides  a positive user experience. Various types are performed on frontend applications. here are common types for frontend applications:-

# unit testing 
- unit testing involves testing individual component or functions in isolation to ensure they work correctly. 
- Tools: - jest, mocha and jasmine.

# integartion testing

- integration testing focuses on verifying that differnt components or modules work together as expected when integrated.
 tools;- cypress, saleniusm, and puppeteer.

# functional testing
- functional testing evaluates  the appliaction features and functionality from an end-user perspective.

tools- selenium, cypress, and playwright are commonly used for functional testing. 

# end to end testing.
- E2e testing envolves testing the entire application flow, from the user interface to the backend ensure all components work together seamlessly.

tools - selenium, cypress, and playwright,

# Regression testing
- Regression testing ensure that the introduction of new code does not introduce bugs or break existing functionality.

tools - automated testing tools can be used for regression testing, and ci/cd pipelines often include regression teest suites.

# performance testing
- assess the speed, responsivenesss, and overall performance of the frontend application under different conditions. 
tools - lighthouse, google pagespeed insights, webpage test

# accessibility testing

- this testing ensures that the appplication is usuable by people with disabilities and compiles with accessibility standards.

tools - lighhouse, axe, pa11y 

# cross-browser testing
checks the application's comatability and functionality across differnt web browsers.
tools - browserstack, crossbrowsertesting 

# usability testing
- usability testing evaluates how easily users can interact with and navigate throgh the appliaction. 

# security testing
- identifies and addressess vulnebralities in the application, protecting it from potential threats.

tools - OWSAP ZAP, burp suite 

# Localization and internalization testing
- application works correctly in differnt languages and regions.

# A/B testing

- split testing, used to compare two version of a webpage or      application to determine which one performs better.

# TDD
- test driven development. it is a software development methodology in which tests are written before the actual code that needs to be implemented. TDD follows a cycle of steps: write a test, make the test pass, and then refactor the code.

  - unit testing and integration testing
   - component testing
   -jest and JSDOM.

# Automation testing
   - e2e test cases
   - tools - puppeter, cypress, seleniumnpm i 

   puppeteer - Puppeteer is a JavaScript library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Firefox over the DevTools Protocol or WebDriver BiDi. Puppeteer runs in the headless (no visible UI) by default.  

# A/B testing (split testing / Bucket testing) 
- we create two or more version of website and split the traffic on different website and we decide on basis of metric result we can decide with the feature and continue with production. This testing helps in data driven decision, and it impact business decision.
