# communication protocols
- HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of rules that governs how web browsers and web servers communicate with each other to transfer files, such as images, text, video, and sound, over the web.

- TCP - A TCP connection is a reliable connection that allows devices to exchange data over a network using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It gurantees no packet is lost.

- HTTP/3(QUIC) - HTTP/3 is the third major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used to exchange information on the World Wide Web, complementing the widely-deployed HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. Unlike previous versions which relied on the well-established TCP (published in 1974),[2] HTTP/3 uses QUIC (officially introduced in 2021),[3] a multiplexed transport protocol built on UDP.

- UDP - User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a communication protocol that allows data to be sent between computers on the internet quickly, but without establishing a connection first. (header compression, Better network congestion, Improved performance)

- HTTPS - HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is a security protocol that encrypts data sent between a user and a website. It's the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS uses encryption technology like SSL or TLS to secure connections. 

- websocket - WebSocket is a computer communications protocol that allows for real-time, two-way communication between a client and a server over a single connection.

- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard communication protocol for sending and receiving emails over the internet. It's used by mail servers and other message transfer agents (MTAs) to transmit emails.
